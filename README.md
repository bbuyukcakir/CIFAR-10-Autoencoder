# CIFAR-10 Autoencoder
##### My implementation of a deep autoencoder on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

This repository houses my autoencoder model that is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model is constructed using 
*Pytorch*. The initial results are provided below. These results are acquired using
'Model_3conv'
